Youtube Bot Detection has become a pain lately, The easiest way I found to get it to work was by importing Firefox cookie files

Download and install Firefox, then make a throwaway google account and use it to sign into youtube on firefox, then close the browser

Make Sure you use a VPN when downloading

This script will download every link inside the Links.txt and put it in your designated folder
